# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I wanted to know what the highest energy songs were listed.

#What are the top 3 songs with the highest energy?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata ORDER BY energy DESC limit 3;

#What was the least popular song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
ORDER BY popularity ASC limit 1;

#What are the top 3 artists who appears the most?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) as number_of_tracks FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name Having number_of_tracks >1 
ORDER BY number_of_tracks DESC limit 3;
